    <h3>This is the story of our family</h3>
    <p>The beginning of our story took place 10 years ago in Columbus, OH.  Actually, it started almost a year before.</p>

    <p>These two young ladies came to our family together as we embarked down the road of foster care.  
    We had the priviledge of providing a home to them while they were seeking refuge from the storms of their lives.  Shortly after their placement,
    their birthmother made an announcement.</p>

    <p>She announced that she was due to have another baby.  Nine months later he joined our home straight from the hospital.  We went from having no children
    to three in a matter of ten months.  We continued to foster these children for almost a year.  During the summer of 2007, we found out that we would
    have the opportunity to adopt these wonderful children.

    <p>The final member of our family had to have a little help from the doctor.  But three years later, with some extra special
    help, we had our only child by birth.
